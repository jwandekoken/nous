# Node Package Manager: pnpm

All Node.js package management operations **must** use `pnpm` instead of `npm` or `yarn`.

## ✅ Always use `pnpm`

- Never use `npm install`, `npm run`, or other npm commands directly
- Never use `yarn add`, `yarn install`, or other yarn commands
- Always prefix commands with `pnpm`

## 🔁 Correct usage

```bash
# Instead of: npm install
pnpm install

# Instead of: npm run build
pnpm build

# Instead of: npm run dev
pnpm dev

# Instead of: yarn add vue-router
pnpm add vue-router
```

## ❌ Incorrect usage

```bash
# Don't do this:
npm install
yarn add lodash
npm run build
```

This ensures consistency across the project and leverages pnpm's superior performance and disk efficiency.
